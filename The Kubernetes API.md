## The Kubernetes API

- **Kubernetes API** - HTTP interface for Kubernetes. User. Kubernetes components, and external components use it to communicate.
- The API uses **REST** or **RESTful** object to represent and change state.
- Formats like **YAML** or **JSON** can be used to communicate with the API, but they are ultimately considered simply **REST** objects when persisted/stored.
