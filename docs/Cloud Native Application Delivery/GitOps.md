## GitOps

- Using **Git** to manage your application infrastructure.
- Git is the source of truth for **declarative** infrastructure/applications
- **Automation** implements what is in Git.
- GitOps tools like **Flux** and **Argo CD** monitor a Git repository and apply change to the cluster based upon what is in that repository.
- **Flux** is built on top of the **GitOps Toolkit** standard library.
- Flux and Argo CD are both written in **Go**.
