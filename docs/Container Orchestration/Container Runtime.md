## Container Runtime

- **Container Runtime** - A piece of software responsible for actually running containers.
- **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** - Standard protocol for communication between kubelet and the Container Runtime.
- **CRI-O and containerd** - Two examples of Container Runtimes that support the CRI standard and therefore work with Kubernetes.
