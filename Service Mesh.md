## Service Meshes

- **Service Mesh** - A tool that manages communication between applications components, often adding additional functionality like logging, tracing, or encryption.
- Two main components of a service mesh: **control plane** and **service proxy/data plane**.
- **Sidecar** - An additional container running in a Pod alongside the main container.
- **Service Mesh Interface (SMI)** - A standard interface for managing Kubernetes service meshes that support the standard.
